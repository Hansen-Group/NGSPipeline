  # Server running the pipeline had python=3.8.10 and pip=20.0.2, but the exact

  # The equivalent of r-base=3.6.3 was installed on the server running the
  # pipeline, but r-base=3.6.3 does not exist and r-base>=3.6,<3.7 creates
  # conflicts with other packages. However, R is only for plotting trance
  # files generated by GATK, and the exact version is therefore not important
  # for reproducing the results.
